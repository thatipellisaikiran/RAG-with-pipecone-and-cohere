**1. Introduction**
===========================
This repository contains two projects that utilize Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to answer user queries based on document content:

RAG Task-1: A Chatbot capable of answering queries based on PDF documents using advanced machine learning tools such as LangChain, Cohere, and Pinecone.

Task-2: An Interactive QA Bot that allows users to upload PDF documents and query them interactively.
These solutions are designed for businesses needing efficient document-based query handling, leveraging cutting-edge natural language processing and vector-based retrieval techniques.

**2. Prerequisites**
==========================
Python Version: 3.x
API Keys: You will need API keys from:
Cohere for embeddings and language generation.
Pinecone for vector storage and retrieval.
To install required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure the following libraries are installed:

langchain
cohere
pinecone-client
streamlit
PyMuPDF


**3. Environment Setup**
=================================
API Keys Configuration
Obtain API keys from Cohere and Pinecone.
Set up your API keys as environment variables:

For Unix/MacOS:
export COHERE_API_KEY="your_cohere_api_key"
export PINECONE_API_KEY="your_pinecone_api_key"

For Windows:
set COHERE_API_KEY=your_cohere_api_key
set PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key


**4. Project Structure and Functionality**
==============================================
**RAG Task-1: Chatbot Setup**
==============================================
-Load and Split PDF Document:
Load your PDF using LangChain's PyPDFLoader.
Split the document into chunks using CharacterTextSplitter for efficient processing.

-Generate Embeddings:
Use Cohere's embedding model (embed-english-light-v3.0) to transform document chunks into vector representations.

-Store in Pinecone:
Store the embeddings in Pinecone's vector database for fast similarity-based retrieval.

-Query Handling:
Upon a user query, the system retrieves relevant document chunks from Pinecone and generates an answer using Cohere's LLM.


**Task-2: Interactive QA Bot Setup**
========================================
-Streamlit Setup:
The app allows users to upload PDF files via Streamlit's file uploader.

-Text Chunking:
The uploaded document is split into smaller chunks using LangChainâ€™s CharacterTextSplitter.

-Pinecone Index Setup:
A Pinecone index is initialized for efficient storage and retrieval of document embeddings.

-Embedding Creation:
Embeddings for each text chunk are generated using Cohere and stored in Pinecone.

-User Query Input & Answer Retrieval:
The user can input queries through the Streamlit app, and the system will retrieve and display relevant answers.


**5. Deployment**
==========================
Local Deployment:
-------------------------------
To run the Streamlit app locally:
-python -m streamlit run app.py

Production Deployment:
Containerization (Optional): You can containerize the app using Docker for easy deployment.
Cloud Deployment: Consider deploying the app to platforms such as:
Streamlit Cloud
Heroku
AWS

**Example Usage:
For querying:**
=======================
python main.py
Enter Query: What was the revenue in Q2 2023?


**6. Conclusion**
===========================
These applications leverage state-of-the-art machine learning tools to enable efficient, document-based queries. By utilizing LangChain for document processing, 
Cohere for embeddings, and Pinecone for vector storage, the projects deliver highly accurate, context-aware responses to user queries.

This solution is ideal for businesses needing advanced document-based assistance, allowing for scalable, interactive querying of large PDF documents.
